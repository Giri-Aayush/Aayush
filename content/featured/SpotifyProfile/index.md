I made this project at [ETHGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/) - [HackFS](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/chat-feature-lens-xmtp-41soo) 22. The project is made with the help of [XMTP](https://github.com/xmtp/) protocol which is at core of this project.This project is a fusion of XMTP and [Lens](https://lens.xyz/) protocol. The integration with Lenster has been achieved using the Lens API which enables us to search for user handle ID's using wallet addresses and vice versa.
