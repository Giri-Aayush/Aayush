This project is a decentralized file storage system management application that runs in the blockchain and uses [interplanetary file system](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs) . We'll develop smart contracts that store the location of these files and put them on [local blockchain](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/), allowing the user to view, upload and download files from [DropChain](https://github.com/Giri-Aayush/DropChain-BlockChain).
